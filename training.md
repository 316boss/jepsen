## Distributed Systems Fundamentals

A two day lecture & discussion class for engineers who need an overview of
distributed systems concepts and techniques, from papers to production. We
[cover](https://github.com/aphyr/distsys-class) the basics of nodes and
networks, common network protocols, clocks, availability, consistency, and a
spectrum of distributed algorithms, followed by a discussion of latency scales,
engineering patterns, and running services in production.

Requirements:

  - A whiteboard

## Jepsen Training

A two day workshop which guides students through writing a Jepsen test: from a
fresh cluster to finding a consistency anomaly in an open-source database. We
begin with an an introduction to the Clojure programming language, discuss the
architecture of the Jepsen library, and spend the bulk of the class writing a
test itself. Smaller class sizes (~4-12 participants) are recommended. Prior
programming experience and proficiency at the command line are strongly
encouraged.

Requirements:

  - Lectern with power and video hookups
  - Projector
  - A *nix computer for each participant, with
    - Oracle JDK8
    - Internet access
    - Root or sudo access to a five-node Debian Jessie cluster (one cluster per
      participant)
